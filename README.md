codeceptjs-ava
==============


## TODO

- DONE Auto-Wait for elements automatically on 'click'
- DONE Create valid error screenshot file names
- DONE Save error screenshot to output directory
- DONE Save debug screenshots automatically after each step

- DOES NOT WORK: Make full page screenshots
- test name should be part of the output directory
- Extend Auto-Wait to all methods which are using selectors
- Save screenshot when ava assertion fails
- Try chrome headless
- Mark failed area on page
- Map codeceptjs assertion errors to ava assertion error
- Suppport webdriverio errors
- Convenience functions to login/cache login session (speed up login)
- Store last successful screenshot and show on error compared with error screen
- Show test duration
- cleanup error screenshots before each test run
- Would be nice if chrome would not steal the focus
- Remove wrapped methods from call stack: WebDriverIO.wrapped [as seeNumberOfElements] (wrap-methods.js:34:31)
- Would be cool to integrate something like quokka
